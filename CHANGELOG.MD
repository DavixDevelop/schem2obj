- [0.4](https://github.com/DavixDevelop/schem2obj/releases/tag/v0.4-alpha)
  - Removed ResourcePackUtility, which loaded all resources into memory, created Materials, BlockModels, and BlockStates from them, and stored them in memory, regardless if they were used or not
  - Introduced ResourceLoader that handles both built-in assets, resources in folders, and resources in zip/jar files
- [0.3](https://github.com/DavixDevelop/schem2obj/releases/tag/v0.3-alpha)
    - Added new required parameter `-minecraftFolder` (absolute path to Minecraft installation game directory)

    - Removed Minecraft textures, models, and blockstates from resources
- [0.2](https://github.com/DavixDevelop/schem2obj/releases/tag/v0.2-alpha)
    - Introduced the concept of cube models, where the CubeModelFactory first converts the block models to cube models, and then another Factory (In this case WavefrontObjectFactory) exports the cube model to its format, which can then be written to a file.
    - Removed the old wavefront-specific custom blocks in favor of the new cube model blocks and entities
    - Added support for beds as the first tile entity
