A java program for converting Minecraft 1.12 schematics to OBJ (Wavefront)
with support for multiple resource packs (only in SEUS Format for now). The MTL file uses
the PBR .mtl extension, so for now importing of MTL files (when resource pack is used) is only supported
on Blender 3.4 Alpha

Currently in development
